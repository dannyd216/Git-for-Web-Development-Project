    inline elements do not require a new line to be made they can be placed next to elements in a line instead of seperation

    When positioned absolutely the element will move relative to its parent container. 

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

    // BLOCK BY DEFAULT   // OTHERS
    <div>        // <form>    // section
    <h1 - h6>    // <header>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

    So apparently elements will collide and be overlapping which is not acceptable. At the top of a page you should add "box-sizing: border-box;" and items will stay in their respective spaces and not overlap

    box-sizing: border-box;
